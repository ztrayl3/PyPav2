# PyPav2

A simple python module for the [Pavlok 2](https://www.pavlok.com) habit breaking device. The product was released with an API that utilizes a web service, but this module directly connects to the device via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). While the module is essentially a wrapper around the linux gatttool, the code allows for very simple usage of the Pavlok 2 device.

Specifically, this project began as a way to implement the Pavlok 2 as a viable and cost effective alternative fear conditioning tool in behavioral psychology. An easy python interface, convenient attachment to the subject, and effective shock elliciting allow it to potentially serve a purpose in psychology research as well as consumer use. As of Fall 2021, it is currently planned to be used in an EEG study with human subjects!

and of course the [Pavlok official website](https://pavlok.com/)

## Requirements:
- Python 3 (works on Python 2 as well, but support has ended)
- Modules necessary: pexpect, math, datetime
- Gatttool (bluetooth low energy tool, standard in Ubuntu with Bluez, requires a BLE capable device)
*Please note that this software has only been tested in Linux and with the Bluez tools, Windows may eventually have compatability but not in the near future*

## Stimulus Arguments:
- level: an integer from 0 to 10
- count: number of times to repeat stimulus 0 - 7
- duration_on: stimulus duration in seconds (max 10 seconds, minimum .11 seconds) *
- gap: time in milliseconds between simulus repetitions (see duration_on restrictions) *
- example: device.beep(10, 2, 1, 1)

\* *duration_on* and *gap* only apply to the beep and vibrate functions, shock does not allow for repetition beyond one shock natively. Shock repetition *can* be performed outside of the function, though there is a 700ms delay between each shock.

### Usage
    from PyPav2 import Pavlok
    device = Pavlok(mac="mac:address:of:your:device")
    
    device.beep(5)
    device.shock(2, count=2)
    device.beep(10, count=1, duration_on=1.5)
    device.vibrate(10, count=2, duration_on=1, gap=.5)

    device.button_assign("vibrate", 7, count=2, duration_on=.5, gap=.5)

## Clock Arguments:
- sync: boolean value to synchronize Pavlok 2 clock with computer's UTC time
- utcd: integer difference of local timezone from UTC (ex: US Central time = -5)
- dst: boolean value to adjust for US daylight savings time

### Usage
    device.clock()  # return time from Pavlok 2 on-board clock
    device.clock(sync=True)  # synchronize clock to UTC time on computer
    device.clock(sync=True, utcd=-5, dst=False)  # synchronize clock to local time, denoted by UTC difference and daylight savings time

## Miscellaneous Functions:
    device.battery()  # returns integer battery percentage
    device.vibe_count()  # returns integer tally of vibrate calls
    device.beep_count()  # returns integer tally of beep calls
    device.shock_count()  # returns integer tally of shock calls

## To-Do:
- implement in pygatt not pexpect
- a button count function
- LED control
- accelerometer/gyroscope access
- alarm configuration
